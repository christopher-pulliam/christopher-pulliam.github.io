*WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

I am a PhD Candidate at Columbia University School of Social Work. My research focuses on intergenerational mobility, poverty, and the social safety net. I am especially interested in how income-support policies affect the transmission of health and economic status across generations. Before Columbia, I was a research analyst at the Brookings Institution, where I focused on inequality, social mobility, and the American middle class. I hold an MPA from the Maxwell School of Syracuse University. 

I am on the 2025-2026 job market.
